Company : CODEC Technologies 

Name: Kiruba Sherlin. A

Domain: Artificial Intelligence

Duration: One Month

Description about the task: STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTOR

Tools & Technologies Used:

Python: Core programming language
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
yFinance: For downloading historical stock data
Scikit-learn (sklearn): Machine learning library (used for Linear Regression)
Matplotlib: Data visualization

   This project demonstrates a simple stock price prediction model using Linear Regression in Python. The model predicts the next dayâ€™s closing price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock based on the current day's closing price. Historical stock data is collected using the yfinance library, and data preprocessing is performed with pandas. The model is built and trained using scikit-learn, and the results are visualized using matplotlib. This beginner-friendly project showcases how basic machine learning can be applied to financial data for time series prediction, with a focus on simplicity and clear visualization of actual vs. predicted stock prices.
